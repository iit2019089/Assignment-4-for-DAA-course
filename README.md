## Problem Statement
Given a sorted array and a value x, the floor of x is the largest element in array smaller than or equal to x. Write efficient functions to find floor of x.

## How to use Code
# Download project
1. git clone https://github.com/iit2019089/Assignment-4-for-DAA-course
2. Change directory to Assignment-4-for-DAA-course
3. open terminal in this directory
4. enter command g++ Group-29 DAA Assignment-4.cpp
5. Run the executable file


Output

Prints the floor of a number in a random generated sorted array


**Test case**

Find floor
```
Test Case-1
Array: 1 9 14 15 25 30 39
x: 23
Out: 15
```
#--------------------------#
 ```
Test Case-2
Array: 3 10 18 24 28 34 41
x: 33
Out: 28
```
### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

The worst case time complexity for linear search approach and the divide and conquer approach are O(n) and O(log n) respectively. Best case time complexity for linear search approach is O(1)

**Space Complexity**
No extra space is required for any additional array or such. so, the space complexity will be constant for both the approaches.
Space Complexity: O(1)
